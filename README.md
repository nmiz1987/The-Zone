# The Zone

I have always liked to put all the links I use on a daily basis in one place, so that everything is accessible in one place. For those who know, Google has something similar when opening a new tab, a sort of default tab when there is no link in the path.
I created the same page and added two external APIs: the first loads a new image at the top of the page, and the second imports a famous quote from the software world, both of which load something new with each refresh.
I planted an Easter egg on the page, see if you can find it ðŸ˜‰
